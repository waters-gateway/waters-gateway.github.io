We aim to advance the understanding of changes in leaf anatomy by investigating deep- learning based instance segmentation of leaf cells. Accordingly, state-of-the-art (cell) in- stance segmentation methods are discussed. Based on the discussion, we investigated 2D- and 3D-Cellpose with and without additional semantic information. In general, we found that Cellpose is not suited well for the task, but might be suited for segmenting roundish (sponge and palisade) cells. We conclude that further research is required and propose to investigate embedding-based approaches.},

Implicit representations, if well designed, can come to the rescue. Unbounded n-Gmaps are surrounded by an infinite background region that renders pixel-oriented implicit representation schemes inconvenient. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose an implicit, membrane-centric (rather than pixel-centric) arrangement of darts in unbounded n-Gmaps. Second, we introduce involutions based on bit flips, which allow efficient iterations in membranes and have the potential to speed up computations. We have validated our approach on a variety of 2D and 3D images, including those whose memory requirements would far exceed the main memory.},

Creating such nGmaps from labeled images is a solved problem in 2D and 3D using incremental algorithms. We present a new approach that works in arbitrary dimensions. To achieve this in an effective manner, we perform the necessary operations implicitly using theory rather than explicitly in memory. First we define implicit nGmaps. We then present a scheme to construct said nGmap representing an nD pixel/voxel-grid implicitly. Thirdly we give a description of the process needed to reduce such implicit nGmap. We demonstrate that our implicit approach is able to reduce nGmaps in a fraction of otherwise necessary memory.},

The hierarchy and the complexity of the image pyramid are mainly controlled by the choice of a contraction kernel. In this work we propose a formal grammar for selecting contraction kernels for plateau regions in binary and multi-label images. Our method enables parallel computing through selection of independent edges to contract, and efficiency is achieved by finding a good balance between the number of contraction and simplification operations, needed after the application of the kernel. We show that our method achieves regularity and produces pyramids of height similar to regular pyramid schemes on plateau regions. Finally, we present possible solutions to generalize our approach to design a Connected Component Labeling algorithm that is both efficient and correct.},
